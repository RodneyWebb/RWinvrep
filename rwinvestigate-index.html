    <h1>Rodney's Investigative Report for Capstone Project</h1>
    <p>The API I would like to use includes quotes for inspiration and motivation that users will be able to receive regularly. The goal is to generate a random message of encouragement each time the 'Quote' button is pressed.</p>
    <p>Below is an example:</p>
    <br>
    <button onclick="getapi()">'Quote'</button>



    <script src="rwinvestigate-script.js"></script>
